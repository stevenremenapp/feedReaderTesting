# Udacity FEND Project 4 Overview

## Feed Reader Testing

In this project I am given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and I'm now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. I completed the test suite by writing six more specs for both synchronous and asynchronous JavaScript.

## To Run and/or Edit the Application

- Download or clone this repo.
- See the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file to see/edit the tests.
- Open index.html in the browser to run the application and tests.

## But I just want to see the tests you wrote...

Fair enough! Click through in this repo to open the jasmine/spec/feedreader.js file.
